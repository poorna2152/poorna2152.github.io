      I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, focusing on High Performance Computing, Compiler Optimization, and Heterogeneous Systems.

      With a strong background in compiler engineering from my work at WSO2, I'm passionate about building efficient systems that leverage modern hardware capabilities like GPUs and accelerators. My research interests span MLIR, OpenMP, SYCL, and GPU portability frameworks.

      Beyond research, I'm an avid blogger and open-source contributor.
