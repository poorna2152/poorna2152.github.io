The Last Layer: Rethinking My Fitness, From Cholesterol to VO2 Max
Date: January 2, 2026 Tags: Fitness, VO2 Max, Health, Goals, Independence
Consistency is often sold as the hardest part of fitness. For the last two years, I’ve mastered it. I’ve shown up to the gym more regularly than ever before in my life. But looking back, I realize that while my attendance was perfect, my effort was plateauing. I haven't been pushing limits; I've been coasting in my comfort zone.
So, let's forget about the past. This post is about drawing a line in the sand and defining real targets.
The "Last Layer" Problem
For a long time, I’ve chased the dream of a visible six-pack. However, I’ve been stuck fighting that stubborn last layer of lower belly fat. We've all heard the sayings: "You can't spot reduce fat" and "The last place you gain it is the last place you lose it." I’m finding out the hard way that these are true. Sometimes I honestly wonder if there is a genetic component at play making it so difficult to lose that specific pocket of fat.
To understand why this layer won't budge, I have to look at my nutrition history. Before moving to the USA, I was working as a Software Engineer in Sri Lanka. I didn't have total control over my meals, but I was strict about quantity. I cut out office snacks, mostly because a health check revealed a shock: my cholesterol was at 254.
Through research, I learned that lifting weights alone wasn't the magic bullet for cholesterol—I needed steady-state cardio. By incorporating incline walking and indoor cycling, I managed to pull my numbers down to 210 before leaving the country. I was disciplined then, avoiding chocolates and pastries.
The American Diet Trap
That discipline took a nosedive when I moved to the US. For whatever reason, I fell into the trap of ice cream, chocolates, and processed foods. That diet shift is exactly why that last layer of fat is still hanging around.
But it’s not just about aesthetics anymore. It’s about longevity.
The Data Wake-Up Call
I recently read Outlive by Peter Attia, which changed my perspective entirely. Attia places a massive emphasis on VO2 Max as a metric for longevity.
I bought an Oura Ring to track my health (though I sold it a month later—without a subscription, the data is useless). Before I sold it, I measured my VO2 Max. The result? 43.
For a 27-year-old, that is a shame. It shouldn't be that low.
The contrast became even sharper when I spoke to one of my advisors. He is nearly 60 years old but looks like he's in his 40s. His secret? He runs and do interval training four times a week. His VO2 Max is 40—almost the same as mine, despite a 30-year age gap.
Meanwhile, I was doing a "bro-split" (2 upper body days, 2 lower body days) and a lazy 30 minutes on the bike. I wasn't even hitting 6,000 steps a day. I was lifting the same old weights, with no progressive overload and no real purpose.
The Realization of Control
I’m boiling this down to two main variables: nutrition and workout intensity. The plan seems simple: be strict with the diet and push much harder in the gym. It sounds like the perfect formula.
So, why didn’t I think of this before? I’m pretty sure I did think of it. I just failed to execute it.
What changed now? I realized that living independently means the end of the blame game. It took a while to settle down here in the US and identify how to control my environment, but finally I have some control. I am the only one who can fine-tune these parameters. Its a new year, and hopefully, I can tweak these parameters for the better.
The 2026 Strategy
This year, the goal isn't just to "go to the gym." The goal is to prioritize my cardiac health and metabolism. Here is the plan:
1. Nutrition Reset
I am aggressively cutting down on processed foods and sugar, hopefully to zero. I’ve also started Intermittent Fasting (today is Day 1). I need to fix my metabolic baseline before I worry about anything else.
2. The Marathon Goal (Delayed)
I would love to run a marathon this year. However, it is winter in Blacksburg, and buying the necessary cold-weather gear would cost me at least another $200. I’m going to be smart about this and wait until March to start formal marathon training.
3. The "Winter Arc" Routine
Until the weather warms up in March, I am switching my routine to a 6-day split focused on rebuilding my engine:
Legs: 2 days
Upper Body: 1 day
Zone 2 Cardio (Bike): 2 days
Interval Training: 1 day
This routine is designed to prep my body for the running volume coming in the spring.
It’s time to stop going through the motions. I’ll keep updating this blog with my progress and new discoveries. There is a lot more to write about regarding nutrition specifics, sleep protocols, and flexibility work that I've discovered so far. I'll keep adding to the story.
Here’s to finally losing that last layer. Happy New Year!
