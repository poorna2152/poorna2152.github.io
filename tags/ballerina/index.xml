Javascript is not suitable to run resource intensive applications such as AR-VR, video editing and 3D games. WebAssembly (wasm) was initially proposed as a compilation target for higher level languages which enabled them to run on web browsers with the additional performance gains for running computational intensive applications. Tensorflow, Unity, GoogleEarth and many more applications already use wasm to run on web browsers.</description></item><item><title>WebAssembly backend for Ballerina</title><link>https://poorna2152.github.io/tech/wasm-backend/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2022 15:30:03 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://poorna2152.github.io/tech/wasm-backend/</guid><description>Up to recently Javascript has been the only language which we can use to write programs for web browsers.
