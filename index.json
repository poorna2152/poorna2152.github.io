[{"content":"\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-mlir-and-why-does-it-matter\"\u003eWhat is MLIR and Why Does It Matter?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompiler infrastructure has historically been fragmented. You had one representation for the high-level language (like the TensorFlow graph) and a completely different one for the low-level machine code (like LLVM IR). Moving between these levels often resulted in lost optimization opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) solves this by providing a single, unified infrastructure. It allows compilers to define \u0026ldquo;dialects\u0026rdquo;—modular levels of abstraction that can mix and match. It serves as the backbone for modern machine learning compilers like XLA (used by TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you write code in JAX, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t go straight to machine code. It gets lowered into the \u003cstrong\u003eStableHLO\u003c/strong\u003e dialect, then usually to the \u003cstrong\u003eLinalg\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003eAffine\u003c/strong\u003e dialects, and finally to LLVM IR or NVVM for hardware execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause MLIR sits right in the middle of this pipeline, it is the critical path for performance. If an MLIR pass handles a loop inefficiently, the final application runs slowly, regardless of how fast the hardware is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-problem-correctness-vs-performance\"\u003eThe Problem: Correctness vs. Performance\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost compiler testing focuses on \u003cstrong\u003ecorrectness\u003c/strong\u003e. We run fuzzers to answer the question: \u003cem\u003e\u0026ldquo;Does the compiler crash, or does it produce the wrong number?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, in High-Performance Computing (HPC), a program that produces the right answer but takes 10x longer to run is effectively broken. These are \u003cstrong\u003eSilent Performance Regressions\u003c/strong\u003e. They are dangerous because they don\u0026rsquo;t throw errors; they just silently degrade the efficiency of the underlying hardware.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetecting them is hard. To test correctness, you just need to check the output. To test performance, you typically need an \u0026ldquo;oracle\u0026rdquo; you need to know exactly how fast the code \u003cem\u003eshould\u003c/em\u003e run. For random, generated test cases, calculating that theoretical speed is impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recently built a framework to automate performance testing for MLIR without needing a ground-truth oracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-approach-metamorphic-testing\"\u003eThe Approach: Metamorphic Testing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince we can\u0026rsquo;t predict absolute performance for random inputs, we look at relative performance. \u003cstrong\u003eMetamorphic Testing\u003c/strong\u003e validates the system by checking relationships between different inputs or configurations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI defined three Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that a healthy MLIR compiler should satisfy:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHardware Offloading:\u003c/strong\u003e For sufficient workloads, running on a GPU should be faster than a CPU.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePolyhedral Optimization:\u003c/strong\u003e Code optimized with polyhedral techniques (tiling, fusion, affine transforms) should outperform the scalar CPU baseline.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSemantic Equivalence:\u003c/strong\u003e Mathematically simplified code (e.g., applying the distributive property) should run at least as fast as the unsimplified version.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a test case violates these rules—for example, if the GPU code is slower than the CPU code—we flag it as a regression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"generating-test-cases-with-titanfuzz\"\u003eGenerating Test Cases with TitanFuzz\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA major bottleneck in compiler testing is generating input programs that are actually useful. Random code generators often produce \u0026ldquo;spaghetti code\u0026rdquo; that lacks the loop structures needed to trigger advanced optimizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo solve this, I extended \u003cstrong\u003eTitanFuzz\u003c/strong\u003e, an LLM-based fuzzer originally built for PyTorch. I added a JAX backend and fed it kernels from the \u003cstrong\u003ePolyBench\u003c/strong\u003e suite. This allowed the LLM to generate syntactically valid JAX programs that utilize the \u003ccode\u003eStableHLO\u003c/code\u003e dialect and contain the nested loops necessary for meaningful performance analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe system works in three steps:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGenerate:\u003c/strong\u003e TitanFuzz creates JAX programs based on PolyBench templates.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFork:\u003c/strong\u003e The program is compiled down three different paths (Baseline CPU, GPU Offload, Polyhedral via Polygeist).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVerify:\u003c/strong\u003e We execute the binaries and check if the performance relations hold.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"results-and-findings\"\u003eResults and Findings\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI evaluated the framework on 45 computational kernels.

Using \u003cstrong\u003ePolygeist\u003c/strong\u003e to raise code to the Affine dialect consistently improved performance. Speedups ranged from \u003cstrong\u003e1.5x\u003c/strong\u003e to \u003cstrong\u003e8.45x\u003c/strong\u003e depending on the kernel\u0026rsquo;s arithmetic intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Semantic Rewrites Work\u003c/strong\u003e\nWe used \u003cstrong\u003eDialEgg\u003c/strong\u003e, an equality saturation tool, to rewrite expression trees (e.g., factoring out matrix multiplications). This also passed consistently. The tool correctly identified when to simplify operations, leading to speedups between \u003cstrong\u003e1.15x\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003e2.48x\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.

We generally assume GPUs are faster, but my testing showed this depends entirely on input size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLarge Inputs (N=2048):\u003c/strong\u003e The GPU path was significantly faster (up to 49x).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSmall Inputs (N=512):\u003c/strong\u003e The GPU path was often \u003cstrong\u003eslower\u003c/strong\u003e than the CPU.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, on the \u003ccode\u003egesummv\u003c/code\u003e kernel with small inputs, the GPU version ran at \u003cstrong\u003e0.67x\u003c/strong\u003e the speed of the CPU version. The overhead of kernel launches and PCIe data transfer outweighed the compute benefits.

Javascript is not suitable to run resource intensive applications such as AR-VR, video editing and 3D games. WebAssembly (wasm) was initially proposed as a compilation target for higher level languages which enabled them to run on web browsers with the additional performance gains for running computational intensive applications. Tensorflow, Unity, GoogleEarth and many more applications already use wasm to run on web browsers. With the invention of Web Assembly System Interface (WASI) the use cases of wasm have moved beyond the web browser. It is now fast becoming a language which is used for edge computing. Cloudflare workers, Netlify, Fastly provides options to deploy the code as wasm modules. Currently there are wasm compilers for 40+ languages such as C, C++, Java, Rust etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy internship project is to develop a backend for nBallerina compiler for generating wasm. Ballerina is an open source programming language designed specifically for writing distributed applications. nBallerina is the native compiler of the Ballerina language which is developed incrementally in subsets. Each subset adds a set of features to the language. Having a wasm backend for the Ballerina language provides the capability for it to run in a web browser and in standalone Javascript runtimes such as Node.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"plan-for-wasm-backend\"\u003ePlan for WASM Backend\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWebAssembly has two formats. The binary format and the text format. Text format (wat) is a human readable format.\nOur plan is to emit the wasm text format and compile it to binary format using the Binaryen tool. Binaryen is a compiler and toolchain infrastructure library for WebAssembly which provides a C-API which can be used to generate wasm and it also provides tools which can be used to convert the wasm text format to binary format.\nSince nBallerina compiler is yet to have a Foreign Function Interface we could not directly call the Binaryen C-API from the Ballerina code to produce wasm. Thus what we decided was to create a Ballerina module replicating the functionality of the Binaryen C-API. The functions in this module are then called to emit the wasm Text Format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enBallerina compiler frontend emits the Ballerina Intermediate Representation(BIR) which is then consumed by the backend to generate LLVM. This BIR is also taken as the input for the new wasm backend. The generated wat file is converted to binary format using the Binaryen Optimizer tool which optimizes the code as well as outputs the binary format. Then the generated wasm file is run using a Javascript file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/flow.png\" alt=\"Flow\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ballerina Intermediate representation is an unstructured control flow graph, but wasm is a structured control flow graph. Initially in the subset01 we were using the Relooper algorithm to convert the unstructured BIR to structured format. But later we added structured information to the BIR using a concept of Regions thus allowing us to remove the use of the Relooper algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother simple approach to generate wasm would have been to use the LLVM emitted from the existing nBallerina backend and convert this to wasm. This is a straightforward conversion but we are not doing this because if we are to directly convert LLVM to wasm we might not be able to benefit from the higher level constructs that wasm provides for us such as Garbage collection (You\u0026rsquo;ll see why later in the article).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"implementation-of-subset01\"\u003eImplementation of subset01\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubset01 of the language consist of:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTypes: \u003ccode\u003eBoolean\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eIntegers\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eConstructs: if-else and while, break, continue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003efunction println\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewasm has integer types \u003ccode\u003ei32\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ei64\u003c/code\u003e.

Thus there should be a way to identify the runtime type of the value assigned to a variable of type \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e, so we can ensure that the castings are valid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first attempt in approaching this problem was to look at what nBallerina already does and replicate its behavior in the wasm side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn nBallerina a variable of type \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e is represented with the LLVM type \u003ccode\u003ei64\u003c/code\u003e. The first 56 bits out of 64 were used to represent the actual value; the remaining 8 bits were used as a tag. This tag contains information about the runtime type of the variable stored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince \u003ccode\u003eintegers\u003c/code\u003e are also assigned to \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e, what if we want to assign an integer whose binary representation uses more than 56 bits to a variable of type \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e. In this case nBallerina stores the actual value in the memory and then gets the memory address and stores this memory address in the first 56 bits. There is also a bit in the tag to represent whether the value is an immediate or a memory stored one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/tag.png\" alt=\"tagging\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasm has type \u003ccode\u003ei64\u003c/code\u003e and it also has a memory to which we can store and retrieve values. So we should be able to replicate this in the wasm side right? Unfortunately no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we are storing values in memory we need to consider garbage collection. wasm doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically garbage collect the values stored in memory. So this approach is not feasible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever wasm already has a Garbage Collection(GC) proposal. Even though this is a proposal there is an implemented MVP. This proposal introduces a set of reference types which are garbage collected. Namely the \u003ccode\u003ei31ref\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003estruct\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003earray\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eStruct\u003c/code\u003e is a data type similar to a C struct where we can define a set of fields and their types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumerical values which can be represented using 31 bits can be stored in an \u003ccode\u003ei31\u003c/code\u003e. \u003ccode\u003ei31ref\u003c/code\u003e is capable of storing references in the form of offsets in wasm linear memory, as well as numbers. Storing numbers in an \u003ccode\u003ei31ref\u003c/code\u003e, instead of wrapping in a \u003ccode\u003estruct\u003c/code\u003e, allows faster retrieval because it lives in the stack. So the plan was to use \u003ccode\u003ei31\u003c/code\u003e to store \u003ccode\u003ebooleans\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003estruct\u003c/code\u003e to store \u003ccode\u003eints\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e to store \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e. So the wasm type of a variable of type \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e would be a reference type (type \u003ccode\u003eeqref\u003c/code\u003e in wasm).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/tagint.png\" alt=\"tagging an int\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a variable is to be assigned to a variable of type \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e it is converted to the respective reference type. As per the above diagram the \u003ccode\u003eint x\u003c/code\u003e is converted to a reference type \u003ccode\u003estruct\u003c/code\u003e using the \u003ccode\u003eint_to_tagged()\u003c/code\u003e function. We can give a type name, field type and field names when defining a struct. In this case it is a struct of type \u003ccode\u003e$BoxedInt\u003c/code\u003e with a field i64 to store the \u003ccode\u003eint\u003c/code\u003e value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn subset 02 \u003ccode\u003eprintln\u003c/code\u003e function was called with a variable of type \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e.

Then in Javascript side \u003ccode\u003econsole.log\u003c/code\u003e checks for the type of the reference it got and retrieves the value accordingly. The functions for converting to \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e type, retrieving the original value back from \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e type and retrieving the runtime type of \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e variable are implemented in wasm and exported to Javascript so it can use them as necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/println.png\" alt=\"println\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project is still going and currently I have finished subset09 of the language.

Javascript is not suitable to run resource intensive applications such as AR-VR, video editing and 3D games. WebAssembly (wasm) was initially proposed as a compilation target for higher level languages which enabled them to run on web browsers with the additional performance gains for running computational intensive applications. Tensorflow, Unity, GoogleEarth and many more applications already use wasm to run on web browsers. With the invention of Web Assembly System Interface (WASI) the use cases of wasm have moved beyond the web browser. It is now fast becoming a language which is used for edge computing. Cloudflare workers, Netflify, Fastly provides options to deploy the code as wasm modules. Currently there are wasm compilers for 40+ languages such as C, C++, Java, Rust etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy internship project is to develop a backend for nBallerina compiler for generating wasm. Ballerina is an open source programming language designed specifically for writing distributed applications. nBallerina is the native compiler of the Ballerina language which is developed incrementally in subsets. Each subset adds a set of features to the language. Having a wasm backend for the Ballerina language provides the capability for it to run in a web browser and in standalone Javascript runtimes such as Node.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"plan-for-wasm-backend\"\u003ePlan for WASM Backend.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWebAssembly has two formats. The binary format and the text format. Text format (wat) is a human readable format.\nOur plan is to emit the wasm text format and compile it to binary format using the Binaryen tool. Binaryen is a compiler and toolchain infrastructure library for WebAssembly which provides a C-API which can be used to generate wasm and it also provides tools which can be used to convert the wasm text format to binary format.\nSince nBallerina compiler is yet to have a Foreign Function Interface we could not directly call the Binaryen C-API from the Ballerina code to produce wasm. Thus what we decided was to create a Ballerina module replicating the functionality of the Binaryen C-API. The functions in this module are then called to emit the wasm Text Format.\nnBallerina compiler frontend emits the Ballerina Intermediate Representation(BIR) which is then consumed by the backend to generate LLVM. This BIR is also taken as the input for the new wasm  backend. The generated wat file is converted to binary format using the Binaryen Optimizer tool which optimizes the code as well as outputs the binary format.

Thus there should be a way to identify the runtime type of the value assigned to a variable of type \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e, so we can ensure that the castings are valid.\nMy first attempt in approaching this problem was to look at what nBallerina already does and replicate its behavior in the wasm side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn nBallerina a variable of type \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e is represented with the LLVM type \u003ccode\u003ei64\u003c/code\u003e. The first 56 bits out of 64 were used to represent the actual value; the remaining 8 bits were used as a tag. This tag contains information about the runtime type of the variable stored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince \u003ccode\u003eintegers\u003c/code\u003e are also assigned to \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e, what if we want to assign an integer whose binary representation uses more than 56 bits to a variable of type \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e. In this case nBallerina stores the actual value in the memory and then gets the memory address and stores this memory address in the first 56 bits. There is also a bit in the tag to represent whether the value is an immediate or a memory stored one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/tag.png\" alt=\"tagging\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasm has type \u003ccode\u003ei64\u003c/code\u003e and it also has a memory to which we can store and retrieve values. So we should be able to replicate this in the wasm side right? Unfortunately no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we are storing values in memory we need to consider garbage collection. wasm doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically garbage collect the values stored in memory. So this approach is not feasible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever wasm already has a Garbage Collection(GC) proposal. Even though this is a proposal there is an implemented MVP. This proposal introduces a set of reference types which are garbage collected. Namely the \u003ccode\u003ei31ref\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003estruct\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003earray\u003c/code\u003e.\n\u003ccode\u003eStruct\u003c/code\u003e is a data type similar to a C struct where we can define a set of fields and their types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumerical values which can be represented using 31 bits can be stored in an \u003ccode\u003ei31\u003c/code\u003e. \u003ccode\u003ei31ref\u003c/code\u003e is capable of storing references in the form of offsets in wasm linear memory, as well as numbers. Storing numbers in an \u003ccode\u003ei31ref\u003c/code\u003e, instead of wrapping in a \u003ccode\u003estruct\u003c/code\u003e, allows faster retrieval because it lives in the stack. So the plan was to use \u003ccode\u003ei31\u003c/code\u003e to store \u003ccode\u003ebooleans\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003estruct\u003c/code\u003e to store \u003ccode\u003eints\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e to store \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e. So the wasm type of a variable of type \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e would be a reference type (type \u003ccode\u003eeqref\u003c/code\u003e in wasm).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/tagint.png\" alt=\"tagging an int\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a variable is to be assigned to a variable of type \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e it is converted to the respective reference type. As per the above diagram  the \u003ccode\u003eint x\u003c/code\u003e is converted to a reference type \u003ccode\u003estruct\u003c/code\u003e using the \u003ccode\u003eint_to_tagged()\u003c/code\u003e function. We can give a type name, field type and field names when defining a struct. In this case it is a struct of type \u003ccode\u003e$BoxedInt\u003c/code\u003e with a field i64 to store the \u003ccode\u003eint\u003c/code\u003e value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn subset 02 \u003ccode\u003eprintln\u003c/code\u003e function  was called with a variable of type \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e. When \u003ccode\u003eprintln\u003c/code\u003e is called with a value of simple basic type it is first converted to \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e type. Then in Javascript side \u003ccode\u003econsole.log\u003c/code\u003e checks for the type of the reference it got and retrieves the value accordingly. The functions for converting to \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e type, retrieving the original value back from \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e type and retrieving the runtime type of \u003ccode\u003eany\u003c/code\u003e variable are implemented in wasm and exported to Javascript so it can use them as necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/println.png\" alt=\"println\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project is still going and currently I have finished subset09 of the language.
